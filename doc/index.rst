TEASER (Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit) allows
fast generation of archetype buildings with low input requirements and the
export of individual dynamic simulation models for Modelica libraries `AixLib <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib>`_ and `IEA-EBC Annex60 <https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60>`_. It is being
developed at the `RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute
for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate <https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1>`_.


This software is work-in-progress. Documentation will be incomplete or missing
and the software may not run properly. In particular the Graphical User
Interface is a beta release and not fully tested. If you find any bugs, please
report them in the issue section of the `repository <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/issues>`_.
